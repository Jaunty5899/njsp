# njsp
i forgot to link the script file (-_-)
i tried to use getElementByTagName with button tag and attaching eventlistener and it didnt work...only way it worked when i added a Id to the button tag and changed getelementbytagname to getelementbyid
getelementbytagname use case still not clear
i took some time to look through js html dom tags
idiocies here and there but i completed it under 30 <(^_^)>
